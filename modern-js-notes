2: Javascript Fundementals

    Variables:
        "let" to declare a variable.
            e.g "x = 'Hello';

            var is the older form of let with some differences

            repeated declarations are illegal:
                SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared
        
            Naming:
                Names can only have letters, digits, or $ and _
                Use camel case
                cant start with digits
                cant have hyphens in variable Names
                case matters 
                use strict makes declarations without let illegal (i.e. python)
        
        Constants use "const"
            consts cant be reassigned

    Data Types:
        Javascript is dynamically typed - a variable can contain any datatype
        Number: 
            contains both ints and floats
            Also contains Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN 
            Any operations on a NaN value return NaN
            Math is "Safe" in Javascript, an error will not stop the script
        
        BigInt:
            values larger than (253-1) (thatâ€™s 9007199254740991), or less than -(253-1) for negatives.

        String:
            surrounded by quotes "", '', or ``
            Backticks are extended functionality quotes
                They let you embed things in strings (like format strings)
                // embed a variable
                alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, John!

        No Char type

        Boolean:
            true and false

        null:
            null pointer

        undefined:
            value not defined
        
        objects and symbols:
            mentioned later
        
        typeof operator:
            returns the type of the argument
